    text: "Before the skyscrapers pierced the clouds, Taipei was a basin of wetlands, crisscrossed by shimmering rivers and dotted with rice paddies. Life thrived in its waters. Small, resilient fish navigated the currents, their world defined by the sun, the reeds, and the rhythm of the seasons. This was their kingdom, a vibrant aquatic tapestry woven into the land itself.",

    title: "Buried Alive, Breathing Water",
    text: "Urbanization came like a tidal wave of concrete and steel. Rivers were straightened, channeled, and eventually buried. The paddies were drained and paved over. For the fish, the world went dark. Forced into the labyrinthine sewer system, they became the city's unseen inhabitants. They adapted, their scales losing color in the perpetual twilight, their lives becoming a memory of a sun they could no longer see. They are the ghosts in the machine, swimming through the city's forgotten veins.",

    text: "On the left, an old map shows the natural flow of Taipei's rivers. On the right, the modern city grid, a geometric overlay that conceals the water's original path. The fish exist in the space between these two realities, a hidden geography known only to them. They navigate by the ghosts of old currents, under streets named for places that no longer exist.",

This is the soundtrack of their world. A world we built on top of theirs, a world we choose to ignore. But they are still here, a silent, swimming testament to what was lost.",
